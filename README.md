The genie interface is deployed here - [Genie Interface](https://dev.d1h9zm8svtg3nj.amplifyapp.com/).

Genie is SquaredLabs' decentralized exchange (DEX) designed to facilitate the trading of pools from Potentia without the risk of liquidation.

Potentia is our novel approach to trade power perpetuals i.e assets with positive powers of $`i`$ where $`i>0`$. Currently Genie supports taking long/short positions on 3 pools 
- $`WETH^2`$
- $`WBTC^3`$
- $`USDC^2`$
